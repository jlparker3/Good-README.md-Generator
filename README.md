 ## Purpose of application
  This app generates a readme file based on your input using node by doing this the user will be saving time in their day and perhaps improving their own application.
  
 ## My experience 
  I enjoyed working with node, it has made me aware of the powerhouse that goes on behind the client.
  

 ## Credits
  I would like to credit node and inquierer without these my application would not be functional.
